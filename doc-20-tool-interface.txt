tied to tool type

have different tool, and its prop controlled by ui

    the ui tree state should be here?

just pass all prop of created object and type to action?


tool has the refs

activate the ref

it has the local pt pass it on to brush

it has the mouse events

BrushCanvas

 see papereditor

todo:
  test brushthin tool working

 > hardcode install brushthintool in brushcanvas.render()



bug: (only wanring for now in react)
 Warning: Detected multiple renderers concurrently rendering the same context provider. This is currently unsupported.
because we have two papercontainer
  but they share the same tree (same context?)
     what is the root context? it is the function BrushContainer

   we need the same context for state to be passed tho

  look into not using papercontainer? just direct paper
   with manual tool support

   we use papercontainer on the tool preview canvas because of
     automatic prop propagation
