tied to tool type

have different tool, and its prop controlled by ui

    the ui tree state should be here?

just pass all prop of created object and type to action?


tool has the refs

activate the ref

it has the local pt pass it on to brush

it has the mouse events

BrushCanvas

 see papereditor

todo:

  hardcode install brushthintool in brushcanvas.render() OK have getTool
 test brushthin tool working OK

  switch tool depending on buttoin click there is toolType?
    brushtool in sketchjjks

add simplestroke tool, use like other path brush tool

do a console to see that we are not redrawing the data   simplestroke when adding new stroke
     console spit out the id of the object simplestroke redraw

do *proper prop passing down* to Tool as pathProp,
        currently we have a getToolProp function

   >> swithc to paper-demo and cliean that up, also protoype
      sketchjs already have paperjs code in it to test ? with multiple paper container
          just simple rectangle tool is ok

do rectangle tool , sketchjs has it
  move it out from old place and new ways, -> tool call dispatch directly 
  
do another brush, we reuse the brushthin just use inner different brush



bug: (only wanring for now in react)
 Warning: Detected multiple renderers concurrently rendering the same context provider. This is currently unsupported.
because we have two papercontainer
    [fixed with same renderer object when creating papercontainer patch of reactpaper
      D:\work\drawing-samples\sketchjs-local\app\react-paperjs\Paper.provider.js]

  but they share the same tree (same context?)
     what is the root context? it is the function BrushContainer

   we need the same context for state to be passed tho

  look into not using papercontainer? just direct paper
   with manual tool support

   we use papercontainer on the tool preview canvas because of
     automatic prop propagation
