mirror widget is it important

context access should it be 
  a separate canvas 
    uniform just one layer, more easy to understand like photoshop
    can implement smudge
  or part of paper (custom object like shape)
     uniform operation, hiding showing, can have each stroke an object, can transform per stroke
     can look into transforming the stroke
     can have independet resolution

     i think for now this is more interesting research
