vars['fillCO'

'strokeCO'


for 'brush' :2810 need to merge this to vars everytimg change of tools
                    vars: {
                            'movement_brush': 'freedraw',
                            'diameter_brush': 25,
                            'hardness_brush': 60,
                            'flow_brush': 92,
                            'opacity_brush': 70
                    },

'pencil' :2797
                    vars: {
                        'movement_pencil': 'freedraw',
                        'lineJoin': 'round',
                        'gradient': 'absolute',
                        'diameter_pencil': 10,
                        'flow_pencil': 100,
                        'opacity_pencil': 80
                    },

'eraser' :2872


'calligraphy' not working in demo too

'stamp'
  set url co.stamp() draw it

fix canvas to be on top, and control in middle
 check prop to brush canvas

button to clear canvas

 OK move brushcanvas top, since it is absolute the original code from simplecanvas to get local coord doesn't work


do eraser, do tool specific slider, use the type as the code,
  may think about changing the state to object instead of flat? but the code use flat
    so leave it for now
  need to change the shared vars key like vars.gradient to be tool specific

test other brush sub tool pencil, calligraphy

test stamp

figure out ui based on type


---
fix image shifting after mouse up
---

pattern and gradient in style.c  can be used for stamp?  see style.js

support of copying other field when changing type,
e.g calligraphy need the url to be calligraphy, see initial_state   co_stamp_image_src:'./brush/calligraphy-1.png'


so this is how we do shared vars field to the draw engine when changing tool

---stackblitz
can't run calligraphy since it uses ./ url need to change it to github when it is deployed on stackblitx
 we have a flag on index.js in stackblitz
