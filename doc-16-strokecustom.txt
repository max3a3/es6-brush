what is passed from react, become custom property

point

simplify
   can do this at react level? no, as need to create the path

   the canvas manipulation of the tip can be done there

   just pass settings like spacing, randomness,  as options parameter with default value if missing the parameter



BrushPaperApp  state is the data state

add

toolState ?

different tree for tool and data


is toolstate

how is the prop gui used in sketchpad

---

we were using brush canvas before as a template

because we only create on the data

so for grouped curve, it is idfferent


try to have another canvas for stroke so can refactro brushcanvas into strokecanvas


the idea is a preview canvas that gets hook to different brush engine

as you draw pass to the drawer , the drawer obhejct doesn't create data but access the context
 afgterward the drawer return the last stroke

 the last stroke is passed to paper, via action!

 and the drawer is also used by the react paper
    there is other program that use preview and paint canvas like weavesilk or sketchpad

because we have to pass the point to react-paper
  and we don't want to polutte the paint canvas?

  so use a preview canvas still paperjs to create the path.simplify and draw it, should also be faster if
    paint canvas has lots of object so we don't keep causing a redraw on that


TODO

add option on BrushCanvas so it is paper ready

use another state for toools

on this prototype we use different useState for different state isntead of one tree like redux


TODO brushcanvas rewrite

 it has brush in there

 what is brush interface

 setContext(context,paper)  // add paper as context is used in demo, while paper is used for other brush

 beginStroke
 doStroke  // called from mousemove  with current x,y  class is responsible for keeping record of last x,y
 endStroke
 draw
