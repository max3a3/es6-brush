this is a learning/prototoype for using useReducer in hook

want to have a button to change the first object color
  don't go overboard with colorpicker

create brush demo

create rect with shape custom shape, investigate how to pass pprop

custom shape prop, update prop ->
   we have prop mapping in customcreate  radius: corner
      how about live? see the property
      can't do this it is radius, and size
      we can map via UI but can't do it in the code (creator and props has to be kept simple)

      code property is radius, size,type

use button to create rect then transfre to to

try updating property by changing property of first objet in the state

objet has type, and we map the type to custom react paper object

try effect, like blur, create rounded rect, 
  can't do this in canvas, but it is in svg 


test redraw
  move object above, test redraw

test tool
   multiple canvas demo, have a button to add the stroke, this is ta tool
  only one stroke? no, this is our difference (artist oriented not programmer oriented)
  
  >> how to keep position in sync,the component has .position but the direct brush doesn't

test prop change
  search for brush object in satea and change color

 
test modifier for different brush 

>> current
why canvas dom overlay capture mouse ontop
  modify brush test so there is another <canvas> copy from bottom
