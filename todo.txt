this is a learning/prototoype for using useReducer in hook

want to have a button to change the first object color
  don't go overboard with colorpicker

create brush demo

create rect with shape custom shape, investigate how to pass pprop

custom shape prop, update prop ->
   we have prop mapping in customcreate  radius: corner
      how about live? see the property
      can't do this it is radius, and size
      we can map via UI but can't do it in the code (creator and props has to be kept simple)

      code property is radius, size,type

use button to create rect then transfre to to

try updating property by changing property of first objet in the state

objet has type, and we map the type to custom react paper object

try effect, like blur, create rounded rect, 
  can't do this in canvas, but it is in svg
