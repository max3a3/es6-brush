issue 9/branch 9
for now the code just use brushcanvas, for prototype event handling can be turned off by css [pointer-events: none ]
     so other Tool in papercontainer can work

     later may be in papercontainer tool

     but it already have the replay? and can generate the point and have mouse handler

     so no need to code Tool for now
